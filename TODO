Add write/read of Sponge average values for restarting simulations, need those or will start from initial conditions as average and may be wrong.

Need to come up with better way to contain restart grids/statistics/instanteous fields in a single file and propagate through to each location it needs to be. current implementation is clunky and has flags in different places and different files.

Come up with way to enter sponge parameters on the MPI_Compact.cpp file

Add temporal and boundary condition hook functions that can do calculations after every timestep for field variable calculations or boundary conditions

Add an LES model/field source to the RHS of the governing equations, maybe included in its own hook for the source field

Implement non-reflecting inlet conditions and reflecting inlet conditions(?)

Implement different computation/communication (overlapping) methods for primary solve portions of code and have flags that allow for choosing which one

Add different colormaps to images, add ability to specify the bounding box of the images being printed out
