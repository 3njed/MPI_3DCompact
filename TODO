Add write/read of Sponge average values for restarting simulations, need those or will start from initial conditions as average and may be wrong.

Need to come up with better way to contain restart grids/statistics/instanteous fields in a single file and propagate through to each location it needs to be. current implementation is clunky and has flags in different places and different files.

Implement non-reflecting inlet conditions and reflecting inlet conditions(?)

Implement internally periodic boundary conditions
