Add write/read of Sponge average values for restarting simulations, need those or will start from initial conditions as average and may be wrong.

Need to come up with better way to contain restart grids/statistics/instanteous fields in a single file and propagate through to each location it needs to be. current implementation is clunky and has flags in different places and different files.

Come up with way to enter sponge parameters on the MPI_Compact.cpp file

Add an LES model

Implement non-reflecting inlet conditions and reflecting inlet conditions(?)

Implement different computation/communication (overlapping) methods for primary solve portions of code and have flags that allow for choosing which one

Add ability to specify the bounding box of the images being printed out

Add ability to calculate statistics of a simulation

Add true interpolation methods to the Curvilinear interpolant object

Add ability to write out to pvtk file formats

Add ability to read in from some standard grid formats
